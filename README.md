# Analyzing-Data---Sex-Offenders
HW2

For this assignemnt, I chose a dataset involving Sex Offedners with different attributes such as Gender, Age, Male or Female, Race, Weight.  Inititally I wanted to find correltaions in terms of the relationship Age has to do with being an offender, if certain races are more likely to engage in this activity, if specific weight calls for likekly hood of offenders, or if majority of the victims were minors or not. 

I was able to import my datset file into my code, parsing the data in python. Unfortuneatley, I was not able to actually correlate findings as my code would nto run properly. I did go ahead and try different structures with various inputs.
